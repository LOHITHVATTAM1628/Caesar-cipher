# Caesar-cipher
The **Caesar Cipher** is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. **Encryption** shifts letters forward, while **decryption** shifts them backward using the same key. Though easy to implement, it's insecure due to its limited shift possibilities.
